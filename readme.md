# Gen-O-Academy

Gen-O-Academy is a one-stop solution for passionate, committed, and enthusiastic teachers whose motive is to guide and contribute to the overall academic upliftment of students, especially those from underprivileged and poor economic backgrounds. This platform bridges the gap between mentors and students preparing for various examinations such as JEE, NEET, GATE, and more. It empowers every child to learn, prepare, and get educated, which is their birthright. Education will now be as easily accessible as oxygen. This platform marks the beginning of a new chapter in the Indian education system.

## What is it? ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The purpose of this application is to strengthen the Indian education system and make it more accessible across all horizons. As college students, we understand how overwhelming it can be to start exploring something new. Procrastination is the biggest villain in every student‚Äôs life. To tackle this, Gen-O-Cademy offers a **study room** feature that enables students to watch lectures of their choice without distractions or clickbait. The platform also prevents students from getting stuck in the YouTube recommendation loop.

Gen-O-Academy provides one-to-one mentorship, guidance, and problem-solving. Students can track their overall progress using the **weekly checklist** feature. A unique aspect of the platform is that students can donate to their preferred mentors, and once they pass their exams, they can contribute as mentors themselves.
